# GeoPublicHealth 0.2

GeoPublicHealth aims to provide a simplified interface for users in epidemiology and public health for QGIS . It is based on the [GeoHealth Plugin](https://github.com/Gustry/GeoHealth) developed by Etienne Trimaille. This includes additional methods that are very relevant for the use of GIS in public health and epidemiology.

## History
Dr. Carlos Castillo-Salgado has teach in The Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University the 340.701.11 Epidemiologic Applications of GIS the last 15 years and also in his work as Chief of the Special Program for Health Analysis for the Panamerican Health Organization, Regional Office of the World Health Organization for the Regional Office of the Americas. In this capacity, he leaded the development of [SIGEpi](http://ais.paho.org/sigepi/index.asp?xml=sigepi/index.htm&lang=en) as a pionner GIS for Epidemiology and Public Health. Now using the QGIS the GeoPublicHealth will integrated several of the methods and techniques used in SIGEpi but enhancing those with the capacities of QGIS.
